Welcome to SpikePlot's documentation!
=====================================

The SpikePlot provides plotting facilities customized for visualization of
timeseries data as commonly encountered in electro-physiological signal
processing, esp. spike sorting. The package uses `matplotlib` and generally
expects `scipy`/`numpy` `ndarray` objects as inputs.
